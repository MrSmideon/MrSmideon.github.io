                <p id="description">Ryder is a character I made for my friend who was joining a Pokemon D&D. He wanted them to be a fighting type specialist and wanted his character to wear
                    a gi. Since his favorite pokemon is Lucario and he was starting our campaign with a riolu he wanted his gi's colors to match Lucario's color pallete. I went through a 
                    few varients of using the colors until we found one he liked. I then messed with his face and hair to see what he liked and finally landed on what we have here. I liked
                    drawing this character as well as going back and forth with my friend to design him. I think he came out pretty well.
